You should memorize the **solution types** for ODEs.

1) First-Order ODEs
- Focus on just two types.
- Separable: $\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y)$
    - Move $y$ to the left and $x$ to the right, then integrate: $\int \frac{1}{h(y)} \, dy = \int g(x) \, dx$
- First-order linear (Linear Equations): $y' + P(x)y = Q(x)$
    - Remember the integrating factor $\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) \, dx}$.
    - Multiply both sides by $\mu(x)$ so the left side becomes $(y \cdot \mu(x))'$.
    - The integrating factor is $e$ raised to the integral of $P(x)$.

2) Second-Order Linear ODEs
- $ay'' + by' + cy = 0$ (homogeneous with constant coefficients)
- The solution form depends on the roots $r$ of the characteristic equation $ar^2 + br + c = 0$.
    - Two distinct real roots ($r_1, r_2$): $y = c_1 e^{r_1 x} + c_2 e^{r_2 x}$
    - Repeated root ($r$): $y = c_1 e^{r x} + c_2 x e^{r x}$ (note the extra $x$ term)
    - Complex roots ($\alpha \pm \beta i$): $y = e^{\alpha x} (c_1 \cos \beta x + c_2 \sin \beta x)$

3) Geometric Applications of Calculus
- Many problems ask for the formula shape rather than computation.
    - Arc length: $L = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1 + (f'(x))^2} \, dx$
    - Surface area of revolution about the $x$-axis: $S = \int_{a}^{b} 2\pi y \sqrt{1 + (y')^2} \, dx$
    - Often the formulas themselves are asked directly.
