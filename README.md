# Tech Blog

This repository contains the source code for my personal technology blog.

The blog focuses on topics related to computer science, with a special emphasis on **compilers and language design**. I use this space to document my learning journey, share findings from reading papers, and explore technologies like LLVM, MLIR, and Triton.

## Content Categories

- **Compilers:** In-depth articles and tutorials on compiler technologies.
- **LLVM & MLIR:** Practical examples, deep dives into the architecture, and experiments with the MLIR framework.
- **Paper Reviews:** Summaries and discussions of interesting academic papers in the systems and languages field.
- **Personal:** Miscellaneous thoughts and experiences related to software development.
